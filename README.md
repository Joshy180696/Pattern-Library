Pattern Library 📚

A Node.js-based pattern library deployed on Render’s free hosting, leveraging KSS (Knyle Style Sheets) for CSS documentation and modular SCSS organization. Originally built with plain CSS, this project has evolved to use Sass for enhanced modularity, maintainability, and import handling.

🌐 Technologies Used

    SCSS: For modular and maintainable styles.
    KSS: Generates a living style guide from SCSS comments.
    Node.js: Powers the build process.
    Render: Hosts the static site with free-tier access control.

✨ Features

    Modular SCSS Components: Reusable styles for buttons, media, and navbars.
    KSS-Generated Style Guide: Interactive documentation with live examples.
    Responsive Design: Adapts seamlessly across devices.
